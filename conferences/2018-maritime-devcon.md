## Rockstar estimating skills

Developers tend to underestimate...

Ask questions before an estimation:
- Do I have meetings?
- Formal processes?
- Prototypes?
- Adding to an existing app? Brand new app? Does a db exist already?
- Threat models?
- Localization / Internationalization requirements?
- Are all requirements defined already?
- Design / testing required?
- Will I have different priorities?
- Will data be provided to me?
- Architecture standards / policies to conform to?
- Known risks and dependencies?
- Review past projects...
- Add more questions
